/**
 * 🧪 INTEGRATION TEST: Database Connection - Alternative Prisma Client Path Testing
 *
 * This test validates database connectivity using the direct packages/database path
 * to ensure both import methods work correctly for the Prisma client.
 *
 * 📋 BUSINESS RULES TESTED:
 * - Database connection establishment via packages/database path
 * - User table accessibility and query functionality
 * - Data structure validation: user records have required fields (id, email)
 * - Connection cleanup and resource management
 * - Import path compatibility: Direct packages/database vs db/index.js
 * - Query result format validation: arrays, objects, field presence
 * - Empty database handling: Graceful behavior with no users
 * - Field validation: ID and email field presence and format
 *
 * 🎯 FUNCTIONALITY TESTED:
 * 1. Database connection via packages/database/prismaClient.mjs import
 * 2. User table query access (findMany operations)
 * 3. Data structure validation (id and email field presence)
 * 4. Connection cleanup and disconnection
 * 5. Import path validation: Alternative Prisma client access
 * 6. Basic infrastructure health checks
 * 7. Field type validation: String IDs and email formats
 *
 * 🔄 BALANCED MOCKING APPROACH:
 * ✅ REAL: Complete database operations, connection management, query execution
 * ✅ REAL: Prisma client functionality, schema validation, data integrity checks
 * 🔧 MOCK: None - full integration testing with real database infrastructure
 *
 * 💡 TEST STRATEGY: Infrastructure validation with alternative import path to ensure
 *    multiple ways of accessing the database work correctly
 *
 * ⚠️  NOTE: This test is similar to database.test.mjs but uses different import path.
 *    Consider consolidating if both tests serve the same purpose.
