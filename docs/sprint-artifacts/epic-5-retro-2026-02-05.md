# Epic 5 Retrospective - Competition System

**Date:** February 5, 2026
**Epic:** Epic 5 - Competition System
**Duration:** 1 day (February 2-3, 2026)
**Participants:** Heirr (Project Lead), Bob (Scrum Master), Dr. Chen (Tech Architect), Sarah (Frontend Lead), Elena (Backend Lead), Marcus (QA Lead), Alex (DevOps), Maya (UX Designer)

---

## Executive Summary

Epic 5 delivered a complete competition system with exceptional test coverage (1,124 tests, 100% pass rate) in a single day. However, the epic was completed **before the Epic 4 retrospective was conducted**, resulting in 0% action item completion and accumulation of both technical and process debt. Epic 6 is now **blocked by 7 P0 action items** that must be resolved in a dedicated Prep Sprint.

**Critical Finding:** 🚨 **Epic 5 finished February 3rd. Epic 4 retrospective conducted February 5th. Recursive process failure: we cannot complete action items that don't exist yet.**

---

## What Didn't Go Well ❌

### 1. Technical Debt Accumulation

**Modal Variants Proliferation:**

- Created 3 new modal variants during Epic 5:
  - CompetitionEntryModal (Story 5.1)
  - CompetitionResultsModal (Story 5.2)
  - PrizeNotificationModal (Story 5.3)
- **Total modal variants:** 6 (3 from Epic 4 + 3 from Epic 5)
- **Root cause:** AI-5-1 (Extract BaseModal) not completed before Epic 5
- **Impact:** Code duplication, inconsistent UX, maintenance burden

**Dual Charting Libraries Persist:**

- Used Recharts in Story 5.2 for ScoreBreakdownChart
- Chart.js still in codebase from Epic 4
- **Root cause:** AI-5-2 (Charting Library ADR) not completed
- **Impact:** Bundle size bloat, inconsistent visualization patterns, developer confusion

### 2. Zero Action Item Completion

**Timeline Analysis:**

- Epic 4 completed: February 1, 2026
- Epic 5 started: February 2, 2026
- Epic 5 completed: February 3, 2026
- Epic 4 retrospective conducted: February 5, 2026

**Critical Finding:** 🚨 **Epic 5 was completed BEFORE Epic 4 retrospective created action items.**

**Action Item Completion Rate:** 0/9 (0%)

- Cannot complete action items that don't exist yet
- No time allocated for action item work
- "Parallel work" fiction continues - we don't actually work on action items during epics

### 3. Process Violations

**AI-5-9 Violated Before It Existed:**

- Started Epic 5 without completing Epic 4 retrospective
- No retrospective gap between epics
- Violated the very rule that AI-5-9 would later document

**No Prerequisite Checking:**

- No verification of Epic 5 prerequisites before starting
- No accountability checkpoint
- No automated enforcement

### 4. Compounding Debt

**Technical Debt:**

- 6 modal variants (growing)
- 2 charting libraries (stagnant)
- Centralized mock data (not happening)
- Test runtime (unknown, possibly degrading)

**Process Debt:**

- 0% action item completion velocity (second consecutive epic)
- No retrospective cadence
- No prerequisite enforcement
- No accountability system

---

## Critical Findings 🚨

### Finding 1: Recursive Process Failure

**Problem:** Epic 5 completed before Epic 4 retrospective was conducted.

**Evidence:**

- Epic 5 duration: Feb 2-3, 2026
- Epic 4 retrospective: Feb 5, 2026
- Gap: -2 days (negative gap = epic finished before retro)

**Impact:**

- 0% action item completion (impossible to complete items created after epic)
- Process improvements from Epic 4 retro couldn't influence Epic 5
- Violations of AI-5-9 before AI-5-9 existed

**Root Cause:** No enforcement of retrospective cadence, no accountability checkpoint

### Finding 2: Epic 6 Blocked by Accumulated Debt

**Problem:** Epic 6 (Breeding & Foal Development) cannot start until 7 P0 action items are resolved.

**Blocking Action Items:**

1. AI-5-1: Extract BaseModal Component (Epic 6 needs modals for Stories 6-1, 6-4, 6-6)
2. AI-5-2: Create Charting Library ADR (Epic 6 needs visualizations for Stories 6-2, 6-4, 6-5)
3. AI-5-5: Complete Pattern Documentation (prevent creating modal variant #7)
4. AI-5-6: Implement Action Item Prerequisite System (prevent Epic 7 from being blocked)
5. AI-5-7: Sprint Planning Accountability Checkpoint (enforce prerequisites)
6. AI-5-8: Eliminate "Parallel Work" Fiction (realistic planning)
7. AI-5-9: Mandatory Retrospective Before Epic Starts (prevent repeat failures)

**Impact:** Epic 6 cannot proceed until Prep Sprint completes these items.

### Finding 3: Speed vs. Sustainability Trade-off

**Observation:** Epic 5 achieved 5 stories/day velocity (unprecedented) but accumulated significant debt.

**Trade-offs Made:**

- ✅ Gained: Fast feature delivery, complete user flows, high test coverage
- ❌ Lost: Technical consistency (6 modal variants), process discipline (0% action item completion)

**Question:** Is 5 stories/day sustainable, or was this achieved by deferring necessary work?

**Analysis:** The 1-day duration left no time for:

- Refactoring common patterns
- Addressing technical debt
- Completing action items from previous epics
- Retrospective before starting

**Conclusion:** Speed came at the cost of sustainability. Current trajectory is unsustainable.

### Finding 4: Action Item Completion Velocity = 0%

**Two consecutive epics with 0% action item completion:**

**Epic 3 → Epic 4:**

- Epic 3 retrospective created 5 action items
- Epic 4 completed 0/5 (0%)
- Identified in Epic 4 retrospective

**Epic 4 → Epic 5:**

- Epic 4 retrospective created 9 action items
- Epic 5 completed 0/9 (0%)
- Identified in Epic 5 retrospective

**Pattern:** We create action items but never complete them because:

1. No time allocated for action item work
2. "Parallel work" fiction - we don't actually work on items during epics
3. No enforcement mechanism
4. No accountability checkpoint

**Impact:** Technical and process debt compounds with each epic.

## Decision: 5-Day Prep Sprint Before Epic 6

### Rationale

Epic 6 (Breeding & Foal Development) is blocked by 7 P0 action items. We cannot sustainably continue building features on an unstable foundation of technical and process debt.

### Prep Sprint Scope

- **Duration:** 5 days
- **Focus:** Complete 7 P0 action items
- **Success Criteria:** Epic 6 prerequisite check passes (automated via AI-5-6)
- **No Feature Work:** Pure technical and process debt resolution
- **Stretch Goals:** P1 action items if P0 items complete early

### P0 Action Items (Must Complete)

1. AI-5-1: Extract BaseModal Component (2 days, Sarah)
2. AI-5-2: Create Charting Library ADR (1 day, Sarah)
3. AI-5-5: Complete Pattern Documentation (0.5 days, Sarah)
4. AI-5-6: Implement Action Item Prerequisite System (1 day, Alex)
5. AI-5-7: Sprint Planning Accountability Checkpoint (0.5 days, Bob)
6. AI-5-8: Eliminate "Parallel Work" Fiction (0.5 days, Bob)
7. AI-5-9: Mandatory Retrospective Before Epic Starts (0.5 days, Bob)

**Total P0 Effort:** 5.5 days

### P1 Action Items (Stretch Goals)

- AI-5-3: Centralize Mock Data (1.5 days, Marcus)
- AI-5-4: Test Optimization Research (1 day, Marcus)
- AI-5-11: Standardize React Query Cache Strategy (1 day, Sarah)

**Total P1 Effort:** 3.5 days

### Success Criteria

✅ All 7 P0 action items marked as "completed" in sprint-status.yaml
✅ Automated prerequisite check passes for Epic 6
✅ BaseModal extracted and all 6 modal variants refactored
✅ Single charting library in codebase
✅ Pattern documentation complete
✅ Process automation in place

**Epic 6 can only start when all success criteria met.**

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Process Discipline is Non-Negotiable

**Lesson:** Speed without process discipline creates unsustainable velocity.

**Evidence:**

- Epic 5 achieved 5 stories/day but violated core processes
- 0% action item completion for second consecutive epic
- Epic 6 now blocked by accumulated debt

**Action:** Implement mandatory gates (AI-5-7, AI-5-9) to enforce process discipline

### 2. Technical Debt Compounds Exponentially

**Lesson:** Deferred refactoring creates exponentially growing maintenance burden.

**Evidence:**

- Epic 4: 3 modal variants created
- Epic 5: 3 more modal variants created
- Epic 6: Would create more variants without intervention

**Action:** Dedicated Prep Sprint to resolve technical debt before Epic 6

### 3. "Parallel Work" is a Fiction

**Lesson:** We cannot complete action items while simultaneously delivering features at high velocity.

**Evidence:**

- Epic 4: 0/5 action items completed during epic
- Epic 5: 0/9 action items completed during epic
- Pattern: 0% completion velocity across 2 epics

**Action:** Explicit Prep Sprints for action item work (AI-5-8)

### 4. Retrospectives Must Precede Epics

**Lesson:** Starting an epic before completing the previous epic's retrospective prevents process improvements from taking effect.

**Evidence:**

- Epic 5 finished Feb 3, Epic 4 retro conducted Feb 5
- Epic 5 violated AI-5-9 before AI-5-9 existed
- Recursive process failure

**Action:** Mandatory retrospective gates (AI-5-9)

### 5. Automation Enforces Discipline

**Lesson:** Manual process enforcement fails. Automated checks are required.

**Evidence:**

- No automated prerequisite checking
- No automated retrospective completion verification
- No accountability system

**Action:** Implement automated prerequisite system (AI-5-6), accountability checkpoints (AI-5-7)

---

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk 1: Prep Sprint Fails to Complete P0 Items

**Probability:** Medium
**Impact:** High (Epic 6 remains blocked)

**Mitigation:**

- Clear 5-day scope with 5.5 days of work (slight buffer)
- Single focus: no feature work allowed
- Daily progress tracking
- Early escalation if items fall behind

### Risk 2: Team Resists Process Changes

**Probability:** Low
**Impact:** High (process debt continues)

**Mitigation:**

- Leadership support for Prep Sprint (Heirr approved)
- Clear rationale documented in retrospective
- Automated enforcement reduces friction
- Process changes improve developer experience (less confusion)

### Risk 3: Epic 6 Timeline Delayed

**Probability:** High (guaranteed - Prep Sprint adds 5 days)
**Impact:** Medium (but necessary for sustainability)

**Mitigation:**

- Explicit decision to prioritize sustainability over speed
- Prep Sprint prevents Epic 7+ from being similarly blocked
- Long-term velocity improvement from reduced technical debt

## Metrics and Trends

### Test Coverage Trends

| Epic   | Stories | Tests | Avg Overachievement |
| ------ | ------- | ----- | ------------------- |
| Epic 3 | 5       | 721   | ~20%                |
| Epic 4 | 5       | 863   | ~25%                |
| Epic 5 | 5       | 1,124 | 28.7%               |

**Trend:** Consistent increase in test coverage and overachievement. Quality is not compromised by speed.

### Velocity Trends

| Epic   | Duration | Stories | Stories/Day |
| ------ | -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| Epic 3 | 5 days   | 5       | 1.0         |

| Epic 5 | 1 day    | 5       | 5.0         |

**Trend:** Dramatic velocity increase in Epic 5. Unsustainable without debt resolution.

### Technical Debt Trends

| Metric             | Epic 3 | Epic 4 | Epic 5 |
| ------------------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Modal Variants     | 0      | 3      | 6      |
| Charting Libraries | 0      | 2      | 2      |
| Action Items Open  | 5      | 14     | 10     |

**Trend:** Technical debt growing (modals), stagnant (charting), or fluctuating (action items).

### Action Item Completion Trends

| Epic   | Action Items Created | Completed During Next Epic | Completion Rate |
| ------ | -------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------- |
| Epic 3 | 5                    | 0                          | 0%              |
| Epic 4 | 9                    | 0                          | 0%              |

**Trend:** 0% completion velocity across 2 consecutive epics. Unsustainable.

---

## Recommendations for Future Epics

### 1. Mandatory Prep Sprints

**When:** After every 2-3 epics, or when action item backlog exceeds 5 P0 items

**Purpose:** Dedicated time for technical debt and process debt resolution

**Success Criteria:** All P0 action items resolved before next epic starts

### 2. Sustainable Velocity Targets

**Recommendation:** Target 1.25-1.5 stories/day for sustainable velocity

**Rationale:** Epic 5's 5 stories/day was achieved by deferring necessary work. Not sustainable long-term.

**Action:** Set realistic story points that include time for refactoring, documentation, action item work

### 3. Retrospective Cadence

**Recommendation:** Retrospective must complete before next epic starts

**Enforcement:** Automated gate (AI-5-9) prevents epic start until retro complete

**Buffer:** 1-2 day gap between epic completion and next epic start for retrospective and planning

### 4. Action Item Triage

**Recommendation:** During retrospective, explicitly classify action items as P0 (blocking) vs P1 (nice-to-have)

**Process:** Use Epic 6 story analysis to determine actual blockers, not blanket "blocks: [epic-6]"

**Benefit:** Clear scope for Prep Sprints, realistic expectations

### 5. Component Library Investment

**Recommendation:** Proactive pattern extraction before patterns proliferate

**Evidence:** 3 modal variants in Epic 4, 3 more in Epic 5. Pattern extraction delayed until 6 variants exist.

**Action:** Extract common patterns immediately when second instance appears (not sixth)

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Today)

1. ✅ Document Epic 5 retrospective
2. ✅ Update sprint-status.yaml with:
   - Epic 5 retrospective completion
   - Corrected action item priorities
   - AI-5-11 addition
   - Prep Sprint initialization
3. ✅ Leadership approval for Prep Sprint (received from Heirr)

### Prep Sprint (Next 5 Days)

1. Complete 7 P0 action items
2. Daily standup to track progress
3. Early escalation if items fall behind
4. Stretch: Complete P1 items if time permits

### Before Epic 6

1. Run automated prerequisite check (AI-5-6)
2. Verify all P0 action items completed
3. Sprint planning accountability checkpoint (AI-5-7)
4. Epic 6 retrospective preparation

---

## Conclusion

Epic 5 delivered exceptional technical quality (1,124 tests, 100% pass rate) at unprecedented velocity (5 stories/day). However, this speed came at the cost of accumulating significant technical and process debt. The recursive process failure - completing Epic 5 before conducting the Epic 4 retrospective - demonstrates that our current approach is unsustainable.

**Key Insight:** Speed is not velocity. Speed is distance over time. Velocity is speed with direction. Epic 5 was fast, but we're headed in the wrong direction if we're accumulating debt with each epic.

Epic 6 is currently blocked by 7 P0 action items. Rather than continue building on an unstable foundation, we are choosing sustainability over speed with a dedicated 5-day Prep Sprint to resolve all blocking items before Epic 6 begins.

**This is the right decision.** The short-term delay (5 days) prevents long-term collapse (Epic 7, 8, 9+ all similarly blocked). We are building a foundation for sustainable delivery, not just fast delivery.

The Prep Sprint represents a commitment to:

- ✅ Process discipline over convenient shortcuts
- ✅ Technical quality over feature velocity
- ✅ Sustainable pace over sprint-to-sprint chaos
- ✅ Proactive debt resolution over reactive crisis management

Epic 6 will be built on a solid foundation. And that foundation starts with completing the 7 P0 action items in the Prep Sprint.

---

**Retrospective Status:** ✅ Complete
**Next Action:** Initialize Prep Sprint
**Epic 6 Status:** Blocked (pending Prep Sprint completion)
**Action Item Count:** 10 (7 P0, 3 P1)
