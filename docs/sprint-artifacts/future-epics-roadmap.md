### Hybrid OnboardingSpotlight Architecture

```typescript
interface OnboardingStep {
  step: number;
  message: string;
  route: string;
  highlightTarget: string; // matches [data-onboarding-target] attribute
  completionTrigger:
    | { type: 'route'; path: string }
    | { type: 'api'; endpoint: string }
    | { type: 'manual' };
}
```

- `User.settings.onboardingFlow`: `OnboardingStep[]` — persisted in JSONB

- `completedOnboarding` flag set true after step 10 — replaces current 3-step wizard gate
