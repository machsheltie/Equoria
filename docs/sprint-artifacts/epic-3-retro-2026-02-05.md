---

## Epic 3 → Epic 4 Change Detection

### New Technical Capabilities

**1. Real-Time Features**

- Epic 3: Static data display
- Epic 4: Countdown timers, dynamic eligibility states
- **Impact:** Requires setInterval/useEffect cleanup discipline

**2. Modal Interaction Pattern**

- Epic 3: Tabbed interfaces
- Epic 4: Three modal workflows (Confirm, Result, Quick Train)
- **Risk:** Copy-pasted focus management logic

**3. Visualization Libraries**

- Epic 3: Chart.js only
- Epic 4: Chart.js + Recharts (radar charts)
- **Impact:** Dual dependencies, larger bundle size

**4. Component Reuse at Scale**

- Epic 3: Foundational components built
- Epic 4: Systematic reuse (Story 4-5 reuses 4-1 through 4-4)
- **Risk:** Story 4-5 blocked if earlier stories have issues

**5. Test Suite Growth**

- Epic 3: 594 tests
- Epic 4: 863 tests (45% increase)
- **Impact:** CI/CD execution time growing, parallelization needed

### Mock Data Complexity

**Epic 3 Mock Data:**

- Horses with basic attributes
- Breeds
- Disciplines
- Genetics data
- Conformation scores

**Epic 4 Mock Data Adds:**

- Training history per discipline
- Cooldown timestamps
- Eligibility states (age, health, cooldown)
- Trait modifiers
- Score progression over time

**Implication:** Mock data maintenance burden increasing. Backend integration becoming critical.

## Team Retrospective Discussion

### 🎯 What Went Well (Successes)

**1. Rapid Execution Capability**

- **Charlie:** "January 29th was a masterclass. Two stories, 310 tests, one day."
- **Dana:** "We maintained 100% test pass rate. No shortcuts."
- **Lesson:** Established patterns enable rapid, quality delivery

**2. Frontend-First Approach**

- **Amelia:** "Zero backend blocking. We built six stories independently."
- **Winston:** "Mock data let us iterate quickly without coordination overhead."
- **Lesson:** Frontend-first enables autonomous team velocity

**3. Accessibility Excellence**

- **Dana:** "Every component has ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support."
- **Bob:** "We built it right from the start. No retrofitting needed."
- **Lesson:** Accessibility as foundation, not afterthought

**4. Pattern Maturity**

- **Elena:** "IIFE pattern, URL state management, Chart.js. Epic 3 established reusable patterns."
- **Charlie:** "Epic 4 will reuse what we built here. That's compound velocity."
- **Lesson:** Pattern investment pays dividends across epics

**5. Test-First Discipline**

- **Elena:** "Every time I skipped writing tests first, I created bugs that took longer to fix."
- **Amelia:** "594 tests, 100% pass rate. Our quality bar is high."
- **Lesson:** Test-first development is non-negotiable

**6. Pragmatic Scope Decisions**

- **Winston:** "SVG deferral in Story 3-5 was the right call. Delivered 143 tests without it."
- **Charlie:** "Grid layout achieved the same user goal. Function over form."
- **Lesson:** Scope flexibility maintains velocity without compromising outcomes

**7. Documentation Impact**

- **Elena:** "Epic 2's form patterns docs (AI-3-3) saved me hours on Story 3-1."
- **Bob:** "We're seeing the compounding value of documentation investments."
- **Lesson:** Documentation is force multiplication

### 🚧 What Didn't Go Well (Challenges)

**1. Mock Data Edge Cases**

- **Elena:** "Story 3-2 had 16/19 tests passing initially. Mock data structure mismatches."
- **Charlie:** "30 minutes debugging why disciplines weren't filtering. Mock data issue."
- **Lesson:** Mock data must match API contracts exactly

**2. Backend Integration Debt**

- **Winston:** "Three epics (3, 4, 5) of deferred integration. Debt is accumulating."
- **Dana:** "Mock data maintenance is becoming manual work. Keeping it consistent across stories."
- **Lesson:** Technical debt compounds. Need integration milestone.

**3. Story Dependencies**

- **Bob:** "Story 3-6 required 3-1 to be complete. Couldn't parallelize."
- **Amelia:** "Epic 4 Story 4-5 depends on 4-1 through 4-4. Risk of blocking."
- **Lesson:** Story dependencies limit parallelization opportunities

**4. SVG Complexity**

- **Amelia:** "Story 3-5 SVG diagram deferral felt like cutting scope."
- **Winston:** "But it was the right call. We delivered functionality without it."
- **Lesson:** Complexity assessment should happen earlier in planning

**5. Learning Curve on Chart.js**

- **Elena:** "First time using Chart.js. Took extra time to understand the API."
- **Charlie:** "Spike before Story 3-4 would have helped smooth the implementation."
- **Lesson:** Pre-story library spikes reduce implementation friction

### 💡 Key Insights and Learnings

**1. Frontend-First Has Limits**

- **Winston:** "Powerful for rapid iteration, but we need backend integration milestone soon."
- **Charlie:** "Agreed. After Epic 5, we have three completed epics. That's the right pause point."
- **Action:** AI-4-2 (Backend Integration Milestone Planning)

**2. Component Composition Maturity**

- **Amelia:** "Epic 3 established patterns that Epic 4 will reuse. We're building a real component library."
- **Winston:** "This is the natural evolution. Foundation → Reuse → Scale."
- **Lesson:** Pattern investment compounds across epics

**3. Test-First is Non-Negotiable**

- **Elena:** "Every shortcut I took on tests cost me more time debugging later."
- **Dana:** "100% pass rate isn't luck. It's discipline."
- **Lesson:** Test-first development prevents technical debt

**4. Documentation is Force Multiplication**

- **Elena:** "Form patterns docs saved me hours."
- **Charlie:** "Chart.js selection rationale helped Epic 4 avoid re-research."
- **Lesson:** Documentation time investment has 10x+ return

**5. Rapid Execution Requires Foundation**

- **Bob:** "January 29th proved we can deliver two stories in one day."
- **Charlie:** "But only because Epics 1-2 established the patterns."
- **Lesson:** Velocity comes from accumulated pattern maturity

**6. Pragmatic Scope Management**

- **Winston:** "SVG deferral wasn't failure. It was smart tradeoff."
- **Amelia:** "Grid layout achieved the user goal without the complexity."
- **Lesson:** Outcome-focused scope decisions maintain velocity
