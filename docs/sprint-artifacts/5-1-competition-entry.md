# Story 5.1: Competition Entry

**Created:** 2026-02-02
**Status:** ready-for-dev
**Epic:** 5 - Competition System
**FR:** FR-C1
**Priority:** P0

---

## 📋 Story

As a **player**,
I want to **enter my horse in competitions**,
So that **I can win prizes and earn XP**.

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

**Given** I am on the competition page
**When** I select a competition and enter an eligible horse
**Then** my horse is registered for the competition

**And** I see available competitions filtered by discipline
**And** entry requirements are clearly displayed
**And** entry fee (if any) is deducted from balance
**And** I receive confirmation of successful entry

---

## 🎯 Business Context

**Story Purpose:**
Create the competition entry interface that enables players to browse available competitions, select eligible horses, and register for competitive events. This is the foundational story for Epic 5 (Competition System) and unlocks the competitive gameplay loop.

**Value Proposition:**
- **Engagement:** Introduces competitive element to retain players
- **Progression:** Provides path for players to earn XP and prizes
- **Strategy:** Requires players to consider horse eligibility and discipline matching
- **Economy:** Entry fees and prizes drive in-game currency circulation

**Epic 5 Context:**
This is the first of 5 stories in the Competition System epic. Upon completion, it enables:
- Story 5.2: Competition Results Display
- Story 5.3: Prize Distribution UI
- Story 5.4: XP Award Notifications
- Story 5.5: Leaderboards

## 🔧 Technical Requirements

### Core Functionality

**Competition Browser:**
1. **Available Competitions List**
   - Display all active/upcoming competitions
   - Filter by discipline (23 disciplines from Training System)
   - Sort by: date, prize pool, entry fee, participant count
   - Show competition details: name, discipline, date, prize pool, entry fee

2. **Competition Detail View**
   - Competition name and description
   - Discipline requirement
   - Entry requirements (age 3-20, health status, level restrictions)
   - Prize distribution (50%/30%/20% for 1st/2nd/3rd)
   - Current entry count / maximum participants
   - Entry deadline

3. **Horse Selection Interface**
   - List user's eligible horses for selected competition
   - Show eligibility status per horse (eligible, too young, too old, wrong discipline level, already entered)
   - Display horse stats relevant to competition discipline
   - Preview expected performance (based on training scores from Epic 4)

4. **Entry Confirmation Flow**
   - Review selected horse and competition details
   - Show entry fee deduction from balance
   - Confirm/cancel actions
   - Success notification with entry confirmation
   - Error handling (insufficient balance, horse already entered, competition full)

### API Integration

**Backend Endpoints (Already Implemented):**
- `GET /api/competition/shows/available` - List available competitions
- `GET /api/competitions/:id` - Get competition details
- `POST /api/competition/enter-show` - Enter horse(s) in competition
  - Request body: `{ showId: number, horseIds: number[] }`
- `GET /api/competition/horse/:horseId/results` - Horse competition history (for future reference)

**Eligibility Rules (Backend Enforced):**
- Age: 3-20 years (same as training system)
- Health status: Must be healthy (not injured)
- Level restrictions per show (if applicable)
- No duplicate entries in same competition
- Sufficient balance for entry fee

**Data Structures:**
```typescript
interface Competition {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  discipline: string; // One of 23 training disciplines
  date: string; // ISO timestamp
  entryDeadline: string; // ISO timestamp
  entryFee: number; // Currency amount
  prizePool: number; // Total prize money
  maxParticipants: number;
  currentParticipants: number;
  levelRequirement?: string; // 'beginner' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced'
  status: 'upcoming' | 'active' | 'closed';
}

interface HorseEligibility {
  horseId: number;
  horseName: string;
  age: number;
  eligible: boolean;
  ineligibilityReason?: string; // 'too_young' | 'too_old' | 'wrong_level' | 'already_entered' | 'unhealthy'
  disciplineScore: number; // Training score from Epic 4
  expectedPerformance: 'excellent' | 'good' | 'fair' | 'poor'; // Based on disciplineScore
}

interface CompetitionEntry {
  showId: number;
  horseIds: number[];
}
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Compliance

### Frontend Architecture (React 19 + TypeScript)

**Component Hierarchy:**
```
CompetitionBrowserPage.tsx (NEW - Page)
├── CompetitionFilters.tsx (NEW - Discipline/date filters)
├── CompetitionList.tsx (NEW - Available competitions grid)
│   └── CompetitionCard.tsx (NEW - Individual competition card)
├── CompetitionDetailModal.tsx (NEW - Competition details view)
│   ├── HorseSelector.tsx (NEW - Select eligible horses)
│   │   ├── EligibilityIndicator.tsx (REUSE from Story 4.2)
│   │   └── HorseEligibilityCard.tsx (NEW - Horse with eligibility status)
│   └── EntryConfirmationModal.tsx (NEW - Final confirmation)
└── CompetitionSuccessToast.tsx (NEW - Entry success notification)
```

**State Management:**
- **React Query** for server state:
  - `useCompetitions()` - Fetch available competitions
  - `useCompetitionDetails(id)` - Fetch single competition details

  - `useEnterCompetition()` - Mutation for competition entry
- **Local state (useState)** for:
  - Filter selections (discipline, date range)
  - Selected competition ID
  - Selected horse IDs for entry
  - Modal open/closed states

**Responsive Design:**
- **Mobile:** Single column card layout, stacked filters
- **Tablet:** 2-column grid, side filters
- **Desktop:** 3-column grid, persistent side filters

**Accessibility:**
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance (following Story 4.1-4.5 patterns)
- Keyboard navigation for all interactions
- Screen reader announcements for entry success/errors
- Focus management for modals
- ARIA labels for all interactive elements

## 🌐 Latest Technical Information

### React Query v5 (TanStack Query)

**Latest Patterns (2026):**
```typescript
// Modern React Query hook pattern
import { useQuery, useMutation, useQueryClient } from '@tanstack/react-query';

// Query hook
export const useCompetitions = (filters?: CompetitionFilters) => {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['competitions', filters],
    queryFn: () => apiRequest<Competition[]>('/api/competition/shows/available', {
      params: filters,
    }),
    staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
    gcTime: 10 * 60 * 1000, // 10 minutes (renamed from cacheTime in v5)
  });
};

// Mutation hook with optimistic updates
export const useEnterCompetition = () => {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient();

  return useMutation({
    mutationFn: (entry: CompetitionEntry) =>
      apiRequest('/api/competition/enter-show', {
        method: 'POST',
        body: JSON.stringify(entry),
      }),
    onSuccess: () => {
      // Invalidate competitions list to refetch
      queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['competitions'] });
      // Invalidate user's horses (balance updated after entry fee)
      queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['horses'] });
    },
  });
};
```

**Key v5 Changes:**
- `cacheTime` → `gcTime` (garbage collection time)
- `useQuery` returns object (no array destructuring)
- `enabled` option for conditional queries
- Improved TypeScript inference

### Zod Validation (Latest Patterns)

**Form Validation with Zod:**
```typescript
import { z } from 'zod';

const entrySchema = z.object({
  showId: z.number().positive(),
  horseIds: z.array(z.number().positive()).min(1, 'Select at least one horse'),
});

type EntryForm = z.infer<typeof entrySchema>;

// Use in component
const { register, handleSubmit, formState: { errors } } = useForm<EntryForm>({
  resolver: zodResolver(entrySchema),
});
```

### Radix UI Primitives

**Dialog (Modal) Pattern:**
```typescript
import * as Dialog from '@radix-ui/react-dialog';

<Dialog.Root open={isOpen} onOpenChange={setIsOpen}>
  <Dialog.Portal>
    <Dialog.Overlay className="fixed inset-0 bg-black/50" />
    <Dialog.Content className="fixed top-1/2 left-1/2 transform -translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2 bg-white rounded-lg p-6">
      <Dialog.Title>Competition Details</Dialog.Title>
      <Dialog.Description>
        {/* Content */}
      </Dialog.Description>
      <Dialog.Close>Close</Dialog.Close>
    </Dialog.Content>
  </Dialog.Portal>
</Dialog.Root>
```

### Accessibility Best Practices (2026)

**WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance:**
- Color contrast ratio 4.5:1 for text
- Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- ARIA labels for screen readers
- Focus visible indicators
- Skip links for navigation
- Error messages associated with form inputs
