      WORK COMPLETED:
      - Created comprehensive API documentation: docs/api-contracts-backend/horse-api-contracts.md
      - Documented all 19 existing horse API endpoints
      - Defined request/response formats with examples
      - Documented error handling and validation rules
      - Added authentication requirements
