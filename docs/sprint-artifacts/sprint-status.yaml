      ✅ COMPLETED: Epic 5 retrospective conducted with full team (2026-02-05)

      CRITICAL FINDING: 🚨 Recursive process failure - Epic 5 completed Feb 3, Epic 4 retro conducted Feb 5
      - Action item completion rate: 0/9 (0%) - impossible to complete items created after epic finished
      - Second consecutive epic with 0% action item completion (Epic 3→4 also 0%)
      - Epic 6 now BLOCKED by 7 P0 action items

      DECISION: 5-Day Prep Sprint Before Epic 6
      - Focus: Complete 7 P0 action items (AI-5-1, AI-5-2, AI-5-5, AI-5-6, AI-5-7, AI-5-8, AI-5-9)
      - No feature work - pure technical and process debt resolution
      - Epic 6 cannot start until all P0 prerequisites met

      ACTION ITEMS:
      - Reaffirmed 9 existing items from Epic 4 retro with corrected priorities (7 P0, 2 P1)
      - Added 1 new item: AI-5-11 (React Query Cache Strategy, P1)
      - Total: 10 action items (7 P0 blocking Epic 6, 3 P1 stretch goals)

      ⚠️ SUPERSEDED by action-4-2 (Backend Integration Milestone Planning)

      Original Intent:
      - Epic 2 identified need for backend integration planning
      - Originally scoped for "during Epic 3 planning"
      - Originally covered Epics 2 + 3 only

      Why Superseded:
      - Epic 3 continued frontend-first approach successfully
      - Backend integration deferred to natural pause point after Epic 5
      - Scope expanded to cover Epics 3, 4, AND 5 together
      - Owner changed from Alice (Product Owner) to Winston (Architect)
      - Priority elevated from P2 to P0 (technical debt accumulating)

      Evolution Timeline:
      - Epic 2 Retro (2025-12-05): Created action-3-7 as P2
      - Epic 3 Execution: Deferred integration, mock data approach validated
      - Epic 3 Retro (2026-02-05): Elevated to action-4-2 as P0
      - New Target: Week after Epic 5 completion (not "during Epic 3")

      Superseding Action Item (action-4-2):
      - Owner: Winston (Architect) - better fit for technical planning
      - Priority: P0 - recognized as critical technical debt
      - Scope: Epics 3, 4, 5 backend integration together
      - Timeline: After Epic 5 completion (broader scope, better timing)
      - Deliverable: Comprehensive milestone document with API mapping, integration sequence, testing strategy

      Team Decision:
      - Winston: "AI-4-2 is the proper implementation of this original intent"
      - Bob: "Mark AI-3-7 as superseded"
      - Better timing (after 3 epics vs during Epic 3)
      - Better owner (architect vs product owner)
      - Broader scope (more comprehensive planning)
    acceptance_criteria:
      - '✅ Original intent preserved in action-4-2'
      - '✅ Better owner assigned (Winston vs Alice)'
      - '✅ Better timing (after Epic 5 vs during Epic 3)'
      - '✅ Broader scope (Epics 3+4+5 vs 2+3)'
      - '✅ Elevated priority (P0 vs P2)'
    time_estimate: '1 hour planning'
    actual_resolution: 'Superseded by action-4-2 with expanded scope and better timing'

      ✅ COMPLETED: Comprehensive charting library ADR created (2026-02-05)

      Decision Outcome: Standardize on Recharts (remove Chart.js after migration)

      ADR Document Created: .claude/architecture/adr-004-charting-libraries.md (452 lines)
      - Current State Analysis: Chart.js (Epic 3, 2 files) + Recharts (Epic 4-5, 2 files) = 360KB
      - Bundle Size Analysis: Chart.js 80KB, Recharts 280KB, Both 360KB → Recharts only 280KB (-80KB/-22%)
      - Feature Comparison Table: Recharts wins 8/12 criteria (declarative API, composability, TypeScript native)
      - Epic 6 Requirements Analysis: Recharts better supports complex visualizations (timelines, genetics, composed charts)
      - Migration Plan: Phase 1 (Epic 6 uses Recharts only), Phase 2 (migrate 2 Epic 3 charts, 4 hours), Phase 3 (remove Chart.js)
      - Recharts Best Practices: ResponsiveContainer, composable architecture, typed data, custom tooltips, reference lines

      Files Modified:
      - ✅ Created .claude/architecture/adr-004-charting-libraries.md

      Impact:
      - ✅ Clear decision documented: Recharts is the standard

      - ✅ Bundle size savings identified: -80KB after migration (-22% reduction)
      - ✅ Migration path defined: 3 phases, 8 hours effort estimate
      - ✅ Best practices documented for Epic 6+ implementations

      Epic 6 Readiness:
      - ✅ Epic 6 can proceed with Recharts for all new visualizations
      - ✅ No more dual library decisions needed
      - ✅ Pattern library updated with Recharts patterns

      Post-Prep Sprint Work (Optional):
      - Phase 2: Migrate StatProgressionChart.tsx (2 hours)
      - Phase 2: Migrate StatHistoryGraph.tsx (2 hours)
      - Phase 3: Remove chart.js and react-chartjs-2 dependencies
      - Phase 3: Verify all tests pass after removal

      ✅ COMPLETED: Action Item Classification System documented (2026-02-06)

      Decision Outcome: PREREQUISITE vs POST-EPIC classification framework accepted

      COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENTATION: .claude/processes/action-item-classification.md (800+ lines)

      1. Problem Analysis
         - Historical pattern: 0% completion rate (Epic 3→4, Epic 4→5)
         - Root cause: "Parallel work" fiction - assuming action items complete during feature work
         - Evidence: Epic 6 blocked by 7 P0 items accumulated from previous epics

      2. Classification Framework
         - PREREQUISITE (P0): Blocks next epic, completed in Prep Sprint, 100% focus required
         - POST-EPIC (P1/P2): No blocking, flexible schedule, can be done in parallel
         - Decision tree: When to classify as PREREQUISITE vs POST-EPIC

      3. Prep Sprint Workflow
         - Trigger: 3+ P0 items or > 2 days effort
         - Structure: 3-7 days, 100% prerequisite focus, 0% feature work
         - Success criteria: All P0 items completed, automated check passes
         - Example: Epic 6 Prep Sprint (5 days, 7 P0 items, Day 1-3 execution)

      4. Anti-Patterns Documented
         - ❌ "We'll Do It in Parallel" - Why it fails, correct approach
         - ❌ "Everything is P0" - Priority inflation, correct prioritization
         - ❌ "Skip the Prep Sprint" - Technical debt compounds, correct process

      5. Integration with Existing Systems
         - sprint-status.yaml structure (blocks: relationships, priorities)
         - Automated prerequisite checking (npm run check-prerequisites)
         - Sprint planning workflow (retrospective → classification → Prep Sprint decision)

      6. Success Metrics
         - Before: 0% P0 completion, 100% epic blocking, increasing tech debt
         - After: 100% P0 completion target, 0% epic blocking, stable tech debt
         - Leading indicators: healthy vs degraded process signals

      7. Team Agreements
         - Commitments: Honest priority classification, Prep Sprint scheduling, prerequisite checks
         - Will not: Bypass gates, skip Prep Sprints, re-classify P0 to P1, start blocked epics

      FILES CREATED:
      - ✅ .claude/processes/action-item-classification.md (800+ lines)
        - Executive summary
        - Problem analysis with historical evidence

        - Anti-patterns with solutions
        - Integration guide
        - Success metrics
        - Team agreements
        - Next steps

      IMPACT:
      - ✅ Eliminates false expectation of parallel work
      - ✅ Enables realistic sprint planning (no phantom capacity)
      - ✅ Prevents recursive action item failures (Epic 3→4→5 pattern)
      - ✅ Provides clear prioritization framework (P0 vs P1/P2)
      - ✅ Justifies Prep Sprints (not "wasting time", necessary for sustainability)

      Epic 6 Readiness:
      - ✅ Classification system now in place
      - ✅ Prep Sprint justified by framework (7 P0 items > 2 days)
      - ✅ Team understands why Prep Sprint is necessary
      - ✅ No more "we'll do it in parallel" assumption

      ✅ COMPLETED: Retrospective Gate implemented (2026-02-06)

      Decision Outcome: Mandatory retrospective completion before epic starts

      IMPLEMENTATION: scripts/check-prerequisites.mjs (updated)

      1. New Functions Added
         - findPreviousEpicRetrospective(targetId): Calculates previous epic number (e.g., epic-6 → epic-5-retrospective)
         - checkRetrospectiveGate(sprintStatus, targetId): Validates retrospective completion
         - Returns: { required, passed, retroId, retroFile, error }

      2. Validation Logic
         - Checks if target is an epic (epic-N format)
         - Looks up previous epic retrospective (epic-N-1-retrospective)
         - Validates status === 'completed'
         - Validates retro_file is defined
         - Exits with code 1 if gate fails (blocks epic start)

      3. Error Messages
         - Retrospective not found: "Retrospective 'epic-5-retrospective' not found in sprint-status.yaml"
         - Retrospective not completed: "Retrospective 'epic-5-retrospective' not completed (status: pending)"
         - Missing retro_file: "Retrospective 'epic-5-retrospective' missing retro_file field"
         - Clear requirement: "Epic N-1 retrospective must be completed before Epic N can start"

      4. Integration
         - Runs BEFORE action item check (foundational gate)
         - Displays retrospective status with ID and file path
         - Green checkmark (✓) on pass, red X (✗) on fail
         - Process exits immediately if retrospective gate fails (prevents wasted checking)

      FILES MODIFIED:
      - ✅ scripts/check-prerequisites.mjs (added 90+ lines)
        - Updated header documentation (now mentions retrospective gate)
        - findPreviousEpicRetrospective() function (25 lines)
        - checkRetrospectiveGate() function (50 lines)
        - Integrated into checkPrerequisites() main function (15 lines)
        - Tested with Epic 6 (passed: epic-5-retrospective complete)

      TESTED:
      - ✅ npm run check-prerequisites epic-6
      - Result: Retrospective gate PASSED
      - Output:
        ```
        Retrospective Gate Check:
        ✓ Previous epic retrospective completed
          Retrospective ID: epic-5-retrospective
          Retrospective File: docs/sprint-artifacts/epic-5-retro-2026-02-05.md
        ```
      - Then proceeds to action item check (4/7 complete)

      IMPACT:
      - ✅ Prevents Epic 7+ from starting before retrospective complete
      - ✅ Enforces continuous improvement loop (must reflect before proceeding)
      - ✅ Breaks recursive pattern (Epic 4 started before Epic 3 retro, Epic 5 before Epic 4 retro)
      - ✅ Automated enforcement (no manual gate-keeping needed)
      - ✅ Applied automatically to all epics (no configuration needed)

      Epic 6 Readiness:
      - ✅ Retrospective gate validated for Epic 6 (passed)
      - ✅ Prevents Epic 7 from repeating pattern
      - ✅ Foundation for sustainable process
