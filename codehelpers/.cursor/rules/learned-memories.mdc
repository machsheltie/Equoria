## Future Implementations & Reminders

- When implementing the `POST /horses` route, ensure the `validateCreateHorse` middleware from `backend/middleware/validateHorse.js` is applied before the controller logic.

## Competition System Requirements (Task 1.6e)

- **Rider Required:** All horses must have a `horse.rider` object to participate in competitions
- **Random Score Modifier:** Already implemented - Â±9% random variation using Math.random()
- **Prize Distribution:** 1st = 50%, 2nd = 30%, 3rd = 20% of show.prize
- **Stat Gain on Win:** 10%/5%/3% chance to increase one of 3 relevant discipline stats for 1st/2nd/3rd place
- **Earnings Tracking:** Update `horse.earnings += prizePortion` for winners
- **Entry Fee Transfer:** Add entry fee to `show.hostUser.money += entryFee * numEntries`
- **Auto-Run Shows:** Use `runDate = creationDate + 7 days`; batch job handles execution
- **Result History:** Log showName, runDate, placement, and stat gains on horse profile
